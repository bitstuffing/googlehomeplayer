# googlehomeplayer
This is a django web project to send music and generate a playlist for Google Home speakers with a simple and useful browser (your mobile have one) 

Now it's working with static content, it's just a prove of concept. But this project will evolve 

This project is based on django (it's a django app) with a dependency (pychromecast), so if you want to run this project simply:

python manage.py runserver 8080

Open your favorite browser (please, use Firefox, it's your biggest friend!)

To install dependencies use pip:

sudo pip install pychromecast

Simply is better.
